2.2       Models
The following simple models illustrate some basic principles of system performance.


2.2.1 System Under Test
The performance of a system under test (SUT) is shown in Figure 2.1.

It is important to be aware that perturbations (interference) can affect results, including those
caused by scheduled system activity, other users of the system, and other workloads. The origin
of the perturbations may not be obvious, and careful study of system performance may be
required to determine it. This can be particularly difficult in some cloud environments, where
other activity (by guest tenants) on the physical host system may not be observable from within
a guest SUT.

Another difficulty with modern environments is that they may be composed of several net-
worked components servicing the input workload, including load balancers, proxy servers, web
servers, caching servers, application servers, database servers, and storage systems. The mere act
of mapping the environment may help to reveal previously overlooked sources of perturbations.
The environment may also be modeled as a network of queueing systems, for analytical study.


2.2.2      Queueing System
Some components and resources can be modeled as a queueing system so that their performance
under different situations can be predicted based on the model. Disks are commonly modeled
as a queueing system, which can predict how response time degrades under load. Figure 2.2
shows a simple queueing system.
